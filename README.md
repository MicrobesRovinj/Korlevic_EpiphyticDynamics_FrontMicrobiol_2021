## Seasonal Dynamics of Epiphytic Microbial Communities on Marine Macrophyte Surfaces
This is the repository for the manuscript "Seasonal Dynamics of Epiphytic Microbial Communities on Marine Macrophyte Surfaces" written by Marino KorleviÄ‡, Marsej Markovski, Zihao Zhao, Gerhard J. Herndl and Mirjana Najdek. Raw sequencing data with the exception of negative controls has been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) at EMBL-EBI under accession number PRJEB37267. Negative control samples are part of this repository and located in data/raw/. To be able to reproduce the results the mothur compatible SILVA reference file (Release 138, available under a [CC-BY license](https://www.arb-silva.de/silva-license-information/)) must be created according to the instruction given on [the mothur blog](https://mothur.org/blog/2020/SILVA-v138-reference-files/) and in the Makefile. This README file contains an overview of the repository structure, information on software dependencies and instructions how to reproduce and rerun the analysis.

#### Running analysis
Before running the analysis be sure to generate the mothur compatible SILVA reference file and indicate in the Makefile its location. The manuscript and supplementary information can be regenerated on a Linux computer by running the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/MicrobesRovinj/Korlevic_EpiphyticDynamics_FrontMicrobiol_2021.git
cd Korlevic_EpiphyticDynamics_FrontMicrobiol_2021/
make submission/manuscript.pdf
```
If something goes wrong and the analysis needs to be restarted run the following command from the project home directory before rerunning the analysis:
```
make clean
```
